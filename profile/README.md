## About Coherence
Coherence is a desktop solution that transforms any website into its own dedicated application. Instead of relying on browser tabs, users can generate standalone web apps that behave like native programs, complete with icons, dock access, and independent sessions. This approach helps separate workspaces and streamline productivity on PC and macOS.

Designed for teams and individual workflows, Coherence For PC supports custom browsers, multi-account handling, and private environments. It offers a lightweight alternative to traditional browser multitasking and improves focus by assigning each web app its own dedicated space on the desktop.
